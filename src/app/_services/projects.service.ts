This rate was compared to the manual method utilized in this study, which was considered the true value and represented a 100% accuracy rate. In addition, the prototype also demonstrated an impressive accuracy rate of 98.38% in weight measurement. This level of accuracy can be considered quite favorable when compared to traditional mechanical weighing scales, where obtaining an exact value can often be challenging.',
